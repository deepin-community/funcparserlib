Description: Recursive descent parsing library for python3
 For python3.
 Parser combinators are just higher-order functions that take parsers as
 their arguments and return them as result values. Parser combinators are:
 .
 First-class values. Extremely composable. Tend to make the code quite compact.
 Resemble the readable notation of xBNF grammars.
 .
 Parsers made with funcparserlib are pure-Python LL(*) parsers. It means that
 it's very easy to write them without thinking about look-aheads and all that
 hardcore parsing stuff. But the recursive descent parsing is a rather slow
 method compared to LL(k) or LR(k) algorithms.
 .
 So the primary domain for funcparserlib is parsing little languages or external
 DSLs (domain specific languages).
 .
 The library itself is very small. Its source code is only 0.5 KLOC, with lots
 of comments included. It features the longest parsed prefix error reporting,
 as well as a tiny lexer generator for token position tracking.
